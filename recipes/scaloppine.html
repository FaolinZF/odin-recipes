    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes called veal Marsala, this is the classic Italian dish made with thinly sliced veal scaloppine. It's a recipe
    typical of Sicily, where the best Marsala comes from. Serve with plenty of bread to mop up the sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ pounds veal medallions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup Marsala wine</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place veal between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface; pound to 1/4-inch thickness with the smooth side
        of a meat mallet. Pat dry with a paper towel and dust with flour on both sides.</li>
        <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it starts to foam. Add veal; cook until browned, 3
        to 4 minutes per side. Season with salt. Transfer veal to a plate. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour Marsala wine into the same skillet. Stir to scrape up browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir water and cornstarch together in a small bowl until cornstarch dissolves. Stir into the Marsala wine in the
        skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return veal to the skillet; cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and serve topped with sauce.</li>
    </ol>
